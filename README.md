Final Project for CSCI 1470 Deep Learning - Face-Aging with Identity Preserved Conditional GANs

We are implementing the Face Aging With Identity-Preserved Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks paper by Xu Tang, Zongwei Wang, Weixin Luo and Shenghua Gao. We will use GANs to extract low-level features from faces of different ages and encode the features to our images. This is a generative model with a face-aging objective. 

Face-aging is a new and exciting field in Deep Learning. With the rising popularity of FaceApp and peopleâ€™s concerns about privacy, we were drawn to implement our version of an aging-app and think over issues of data privacy, deep fakes and identity theft.
 
## How to Train (Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset)
1. Run `python download_data.py` to download the the [Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset metadata](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~sirius/CACD/celebrity2000_meta.mat)(817K) and [Face images](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3zF40otoXI3OTR0Y0MtNnVhNFU/)(3.5G). These will be downloaded and unzipped in the `data\` directory. 

## Environment
